# pianoAndmusicPlayer
Our project seeks to emulate a simple digital piano, a multimedia music playing entertainment device. 
The different modes on the device can be selected by a dial (potentiometer) and the currently selected mode will be displayed on an LCD display. The 
first mode will consist of a 7-button keyboard input that will play on a speaker (displaying the current note being played on an LCD display). The second, 
third, and fourth modes will play a preprogrammed song on the speaker (while displaying the name of the song on the LCD display). it will perform reliable 
time and digital I/O through the button and potentiometer input. The speaker output will operate at a high frequency as well as the potentiometer 
input, to enable an accurate selection. We will be using three new devices (LCD display, buttons, and potentiometer) to interface into the Arduino Mega 
board. The potentiometer will control the mode to select the music player type. The UI will be displayed through the LCD display, showing the currently 
playing mode, and will be controlled by a series of buttons and potentiometer. The system will be scheduled using the FreeRTOS package.
